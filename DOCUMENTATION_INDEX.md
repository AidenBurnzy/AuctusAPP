## üìã Priority Implementation Order

Based on SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md:

### This Week (Critical)
- [ ] Set Netlify environment variables (NETLIFY_SETUP.md)
- [ ] Implement JWT auth (SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md ‚Üí P0)
- [ ] Add API authorization (SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md ‚Üí P0)

### Next Week (High)

## ‚úÖ Checklist: Before Production

Use this checklist from FINAL_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md:

- [ ] Backend authentication implemented
- [ ] JWT tokens working (test login)
- [ ] All APIs verify tokens (401 without token)
- [ ] Input validation in place
- [ ] XSS protections enabled
- [ ] Error messages safe (no details exposed)

## üí° Quick Tips

### Most Important Things to Do:
1. **Set environment variables** (5 min) - NETLIFY_SETUP.md
2. **Implement JWT auth** (2 hours) - SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md
3. **Add API authorization** (2-3 hours) - SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md

### Most Common Questions:
- "Where do I add environment variables?" ‚Üí NETLIFY_SETUP.md
- "How do I implement JWT?" ‚Üí SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md ‚Üí P0 section
- "What code was actually changed?" ‚Üí CODE_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md
- "How much more work?" ‚Üí FINAL_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md ‚Üí Next Steps

### Red Flags Before Deploying:
- ‚ùå No backend authentication
- ‚ùå No API authorization
- ‚ùå Environment variables not set
- ‚ùå CORS still set to '*'
- ‚ùå Hardcoded secrets
