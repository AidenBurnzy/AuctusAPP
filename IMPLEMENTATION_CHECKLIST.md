## Important Notes

1. **Environment Variables are Required**
   - App will not work without AUTH0_DOMAIN and AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
   - Make sure they're set in Netlify settings

2. **Auth0 URLs Must Match**
   - Callback, Logout, and Web Origin URLs must match your domain
   - Use full URLs including https://

3. **Database Initialization**
   - Run db-init.js function once to create tables
   - Check function logs for any errors

4. **Token Expiration**
   - Auth0 tokens expire (default 24 hours)
   - useRefreshTokens: true handles auto-refresh
   - User won't be logged out unexpectedly

5. **localStorage**
   - Still used for storing token and user info locally
   - Cleared on logout
   - HTTPS required in production for security

6. **Error Handling**
   - Check browser console for client-side errors
   - Check Netlify function logs for backend errors
   - Auth0 dashboard shows login attempts and errors

---

## Success Indicators

When everything is working correctly, you'll see:

✅ Login button redirects to Auth0  
✅ Auth0 login succeeds and redirects back  
✅ User appears logged in with correct role  
✅ Signup creates new Auth0 account  
✅ User profile stored in Neon database  
✅ Admin code correctly assigns admin role  
✅ Dashboard access controlled by role  
✅ Logout clears session and localStorage  
✅ Netlify functions execute without errors  
✅ No console errors in browser

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Failed to initialize Auth0" | Check AUTH0_DOMAIN and AUTH0_CLIENT_ID in env vars |
| "Invalid Redirect URI" | Verify callback URLs in Auth0 application settings |
| User not syncing to database | Check Netlify function logs for errors |
| Admin code not working | Verify admin.js function is deployed and accessible |
| Logout not working | Check logout URL is in Auth0 allowed URLs |
| Token retrieval fails | Ensure useRefreshTokens is true |
