- Return 401 for unauthorized requests
- Test end-to-end

# Day 4: Testing & Deployment
- Test authentication flow
- Verify all APIs require tokens
- Deploy to production
```

### Week 2: Input Validation & Protection
```bash
# Input Validation
- Implement Zod schemas
- Validate on frontend and backend
- Add error messages

# XSS Prevention

## 🔐 SECURITY CHECKLIST

Before production, verify:

- [ ] CORS restricted to your domain
- [ ] Environment variables set (ALLOWED_ORIGINS, JWT_SECRET, etc.)
- [ ] Backend authentication working (test login)
- [ ] API endpoints require valid JWT token
- [ ] Returns 401 without token
- [ ] Input validation on all forms
- [ ] Error messages don't expose system info
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (automatic on Netlify)
- [ ] XSS protections in place

---

## 📊 BEFORE & AFTER

### Security Posture
```
BEFORE:
- CORS open to the world 🚨
- No API authentication 🚨
- Error messages expose system 🚨
- Hardcoded password in code 🚨

AFTER:
- CORS restricted to domain ✅
- Error messages safe ✅
- Hardcoded password removed ✅
- Ready for JWT auth ✅
```

### Code Quality
```
BEFORE:
- Loose equality comparisons ⚠️
- Code duplication (60%) ⚠️
- Memory leak potential ⚠️

AFTER:
- Strict equality throughout ✅
- Documented refactoring plan ✅
- Cleanup strategies identified ✅
```
