# Role-Based Access Control Guide

## Overview
Auctus Ventures app now features role-based access control with two user levels:
- **Admin/Owner** - Full access to business management (password protected)
- **Employee** - Limited access portal (coming soon)

## Features

### Landing Page
When you open the app, you'll see a role selection screen with two options:
1. **Admin / Owner** - Access the full business management system
2. **Employee** - Access the employee portal

### Admin Access
- **Password**: `0000` (simple password for now)
- **Full Features**:
  - Dashboard with business statistics
  - Client Management
  - Project Management
  - Website Tracking
  - Ideas & Notes
  - Financial Management (recurring income, subscriptions, budget allocations, payroll)
  - Settings & Tools
  
- **Admin Badge**: Shows "üõ°Ô∏è Admin" in the header
- **Logout Button**: Return to role selection screen

### Employee Portal
- **No Password Required**: Direct access for employees
- **Current Status**: Placeholder with coming soon message
- **Planned Features**:
  - ‚úÖ Schedule & Time Tracking
  - ‚úÖ Assigned Tasks & Projects
  - ‚úÖ Payroll Information
  - ‚úÖ Company Documents
  - ‚úÖ Team Communication

- **Employee Badge**: Shows "üë§ Employee" in the header
- **Logout Button**: Return to role selection screen

## How It Works

### First Time Users
1. App loads with role selection screen
2. Choose your access level:
   - Click "Access Admin Panel" for owner/admin access
   - Click "Employee Portal" for employee access

### Admin Login
1. Click "Access Admin Panel"
2. Enter password: `0000`
3. Click "Login" or press Enter
4. Access granted to full admin dashboard

### Returning Users
- Your role choice is saved in browser
- App automatically shows your last selected role
- No need to login again unless you logout

### Logout
- Click the üö™ logout icon in the header
- Returns to role selection screen
- Clears saved authentication

## Security Notes

### Current Implementation
- **Password**: Simple 4-digit PIN (`0000`)
- **Storage**: Role saved in browser localStorage
- **Purpose**: Basic access separation, not high security

### Future Enhancements
To improve security in production:
1. **Change Password**: Update `adminPassword` in `js/app.js`
2. **Multiple Users**: Add user accounts with individual passwords
3. **Backend Auth**: Move authentication to server-side (Netlify Functions)
4. **Session Timeout**: Auto-logout after inactivity
5. **Password Encryption**: Hash passwords instead of plain text
6. **2FA**: Add two-factor authentication
7. **Role Permissions**: Granular permissions per user

## Changing the Password

### Quick Change (Current System)
1. Open `js/app.js`
2. Find line: `this.adminPassword = '0000';`
3. Change to your desired password: `this.adminPassword = 'YourPassword';`
4. Save and commit

### Recommended for Production
- Move password to environment variable
- Use Netlify Functions for authentication
- Store hashed passwords in Neon database
- Implement proper session management

6. Employee selected ‚Üí Save auth + Show employee portal
7. Logout ‚Üí Clear auth + Show role selection
```

### LocalStorage Keys

## User Experience

- **Hover Effects**: Cards lift and glow on hover
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Admin: Purple theme (primary color)
  - Employee: Green theme (secondary color)
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop

### Navigation
- **Logo Click**: Returns to dashboard (admin) or stays on portal (employee)
- **Back Button**: Logout returns to role selection
- **Persistent**: Role choice saved across sessions
