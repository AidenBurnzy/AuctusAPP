# Current Code Changes Summary

## Overview
All changes made to AuctusAPP during this development session. These changes implement security fixes, JWT authentication, client-project associations, and website tracking.

---

## 1. **JWT Authentication & API Authorization** ‚úÖ

### Problem
- Admin login wasn't generating JWT tokens
- API requests weren't including authentication headers
- All database endpoints were inaccessible without proper token handling

### Files Changed
- `js/app.js` - Admin login flow
- `js/storage.js` - API request handling

### Changes
**js/app.js (`checkAdminPassword` method)**
- Changed from simple password check to calling `/.netlify/functions/auth` endpoint
- Now stores JWT token in localStorage with key `auctus_token`
- Made function async to handle fetch call
- Improved error handling

**js/storage.js (`apiRequest` method)**
- Added code to retrieve JWT token from localStorage
- Adds `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to all API requests
- Gracefully handles missing token

**js/app.js (`logout` method)**
- Now removes `auctus_token` from localStorage on logout

### Impact
‚úÖ Admin can now authenticate and receive JWT tokens
‚úÖ All API calls include proper authentication headers
‚úÖ Database operations now succeed with valid tokens

---

## 2. **Client-Project Field Name Mapping** ‚úÖ

### Problem
- Frontend used camelCase (`clientId`, `startDate`) 
- Backend API expected snake_case (`client_id`, `start_date`)
- Form submissions failed silently; data wasn't saved to database
- Editing projects didn't show previously assigned clients

### Files Changed
- `js/modals.js` - Project form submission
- `js/views.js` - Project card display

### Changes
**js/modals.js (Project modal form submission)**
- Convert field names from camelCase to snake_case
- Parse numeric values as integers
- Sends properly formatted data to backend

**js/modals.js (Project modal client dropdown)**
- Handles both `clientId` (frontend) and `client_id` (database) formats
- Correctly pre-selects current client when editing

**js/views.js (Project card rendering)**
- Reads from either `clientId` or `client_id`
- Displays client name with assignment info

### Impact
‚úÖ Project-client assignments now save to database
‚úÖ Editing projects shows currently assigned client
‚úÖ Form data properly maps to backend expectations

---

## 3. **Website-Client Association** ‚úÖ

### Problem
- No way to track which website each client is for
- Clients and websites were disconnected

### Files Changed
- `netlify/functions/db-init.js` - Database schema
- `netlify/functions/clients.js` - Backend API
- `js/modals.js` - Client form UI
- `js/views.js` - Client card display

### Changes
**netlify/functions/db-init.js (Schema)**
- Added `website_id INTEGER` field to clients table
- Foreign key references websites.id
- ON DELETE SET NULL (deleting website removes assignment)

**netlify/functions/clients.js (API)**
- POST endpoint now accepts and stores `website_id`
- PUT endpoint now updates `website_id`
- Properly handles null values

**js/modals.js (Client modal)**
- Added website dropdown field after Company
- Loads all websites from storage
- Pre-selects current website when editing
- Converts website_id to integer

**js/views.js (Client card display)**
- Fetches websites list
- Displays website name with globe icon (üåê)
- Shows "No website" or omits field if not assigned

### Impact
‚úÖ Clients can now be assigned to websites
‚úÖ Website tracking visible on client cards
‚úÖ Website deletions safely remove assignments

---

## 4. **Client Status Labels** ‚úÖ

### Problem
- Client types were labeled "Current" and "Potential" 
- Labels weren't reflecting their business meaning

### Files Changed
- `js/modals.js` - Client modal labels
- `js/views.js` - Client card display and filtering
- `css/styles.css` - New status styles

### Changes
**js/modals.js**
- Changed "Current Client" label to "Secured Client"
- Changed "Potential Client" label to "Needs Attention"
- Changed form group label to "Client Status"

**js/views.js**
- Added client filter tabs: "Secured" vs "Needs Attention"
- Clients filter by type when tabs clicked
- Display status label changes to match
- Added new CSS classes for display

**css/styles.css**
- Added `.status-secured` style (green)
- Added `.status-attention` style (orange)
- Added `.filter-chip` styles for tab buttons
- Added `.clients-filter` wrapper styles
- Added `.list-section` and `.list-section-title` styles

### Impact
‚úÖ More intuitive client status labels
‚úÖ Easy filtering of clients by status
‚úÖ Visual distinction between secured and at-risk clients

---

## 5. **Form Data Structure Improvements** ‚úÖ

### Enhanced Fields
- `client.website_id` (new) - Links client to website
- `project.client_id` - Now properly typed as integer
- `project.start_date` - Now properly formatted

### API Consistency
All modal forms now follow this pattern:
1. Collect raw form data
2. Convert field names (camelCase ‚Üí snake_case)
3. Type conversion (string ‚Üí integer, null handling)
4. Send to API

---

## 6. **Code Quality** ‚úÖ

### Security
- No inline event handlers (all using addEventListener)
- XSS prevention via textContent instead of innerHTML
- Safe DOM API usage throughout

### Type Safety
- Numeric IDs properly converted to integers
- Optional fields properly set to null
- Field name mapping prevents API errors

### Error Handling
- API requests include proper Authorization headers
- Graceful fallbacks when data missing
- Null checks before processing

---

## 7. **.gitignore Addition** ‚úÖ

### Added
```
# Local Netlify folder
.netlify

# Local environment variables
.env
```

### Impact
- Environment variables won't be committed to git
- Local Netlify folder won't be tracked

---

## Files Modified
1. ‚úÖ `js/app.js` - JWT token generation in login
2. ‚úÖ `js/storage.js` - Authorization header in API calls
3. ‚úÖ `js/modals.js` - Client modal updates, project form fixes, website field
4. ‚úÖ `js/views.js` - Client filtering, card display, website integration
5. ‚úÖ `netlify/functions/db-init.js` - Website ID in schema
6. ‚úÖ `netlify/functions/clients.js` - Website ID in API
7. ‚úÖ `css/styles.css` - Filter chips, status styles, section styling
8. ‚úÖ `.gitignore` - Environment protection

## Testing Recommendations

### JWT Authentication

- [ ] New login generates new token

### Client-Project Association
- [ ] Create project with client assignment
- [ ] Edit project - client dropdown shows current selection
- [ ] Client name displays on project card
- [ ] Save updates to database

### Website-Client Association
- [ ] Create client with website assignment
- [ ] Website name displays on client card
- [ ] Edit client - website dropdown shows current selection
- [ ] Removing website assignment works
- [ ] Deleting website removes all assignments

### Client Filtering
- [ ] Filter chips show correct counts
- [ ] Filtering by "Secured" shows only secured clients
- [ ] Filtering by "Needs Attention" shows others
- [ ] Tab switching re-renders correctly

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Token Security**
