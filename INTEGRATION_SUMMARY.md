# Auctus App - Auth0 & Neon Database Integration Summary

## Changes Made

This document summarizes all the updates made to integrate Auth0 for authentication and Neon Database for user data persistence.

---

## Files Updated

### 1. **login.html**
**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed custom login form with email and password fields
- ✅ Added Auth0 login button (`id="auth0-login"`)
- ✅ Added script reference to `auth0-config.js`
- ✅ Kept error message display for Auth0 errors

**Why:** Auth0 handles authentication securely, eliminating the need for custom form handling and password storage.

---

### 2. **signup.html**
**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed password and confirm password fields (Auth0 handles this)
- ✅ Kept profile fields: firstName, lastName, email, phone
- ✅ Kept admin code field for role-based signup
- ✅ Added Auth0 signup button (`id="auth0-signup"`)
- ✅ Added script reference to `auth0-config.js`

**Why:** Auth0 manages password security. Frontend only collects profile information and admin code for role assignment.

---

### 3. **js/auth.js** (Completely Rewritten)
**Old Behavior:**
- Used localStorage for user storage
- Validated passwords against stored users
- Redirected based on user role from localStorage

**New Behavior:**
- ✅ Initializes Auth0 SDK on page load
- ✅ Handles Auth0 login redirect
- ✅ Syncs user profile with Neon database via Netlify function
- ✅ Retrieves user role from database
- ✅ Stores authentication token and user info in localStorage
- ✅ Provides logout function that clears Auth0 session
- ✅ Provides `getAuth0Token()` function for API calls

**Key Functions:**
- `initializeAuth0()` - Sets up Auth0 client and handles redirects
- `handlePostLoginFlow()` - Syncs user with database
- `logout()` - Clears Auth0 session and localStorage
- `getAuth0Token()` - Retrieves current Auth0 token

---

### 4. **js/signup.js** (Completely Rewritten)
**Old Behavior:**
- Validated passwords locally
- Stored users in localStorage
- Checked hardcoded admin code

**New Behavior:**
- ✅ Collects profile information only (no passwords)
- ✅ Stores profile data in sessionStorage temporarily
- ✅ Initiates Auth0 signup with email pre-filled
- ✅ After Auth0 signup, validates admin code with backend
- ✅ Creates user in Neon database with appropriate role
- ✅ Handles post-signup redirects based on role

**Key Functions:**
- `initializeAuth0()` - Sets up Auth0 client
- `handleSignupFlow()` - Collects profile and redirects to Auth0
- `completeSignupProfile()` - Creates user in database after Auth0 signup
- `validateEmail()` - Validates email format

---

### 5. **js/auth0-config.js** (New File)
**Purpose:** Centralized Auth0 configuration

**Contents:**
```javascript
window.AUTH0_DOMAIN = process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN
window.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID = process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
window.AUTH0_AUDIENCE = process.env.AUTH0_AUDIENCE
// Auto-loads Auth0 SDK
```

**Why:** 
- Separates configuration from logic
- Environment variables set in Netlify
- Loads Auth0 SDK before other scripts
- Reusable across login and signup pages

---

### 6. **js/utils.js** (Updated)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated `logout()` function to call Auth0 logout
- ✅ Handles fallback if auth.js not loaded
- ✅ Clears all Auth0-related localStorage items

**Why:** Ensures users are properly logged out from both Auth0 and the application.

---

### 7. **js/general.js** (Updated)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated authentication check to accept both 'user' and 'general' roles
- ✅ Changed redirect URL from 'index.html' to 'login.html' for unauthenticated users

**Why:** 
- Aligns with new role naming (Auth0/database uses 'user' instead of 'general')
- Better UX: unauthenticated users go to login, not home

---

## Integration Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Auctus Frontend    │
│  (login/signup)     │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
           ├─→ Auth0 (User Authentication)
           │   └─→ Manages passwords, security
           │
           └─→ Netlify Functions (API Layer)
               ├─→ users.js (sync user with DB)
               ├─→ admin.js (validate admin code)
               └─→ Neon Database (User Storage)
                   └─→ Persistent user data
```

## Data Flow

### Login Flow:
1. User clicks "Sign In with Auth0"
2. → Redirected to Auth0 hosted login
3. → Auth0 authenticates user
4. → Redirected back to app with auth code
5. → `auth.js` exchanges code for token
6. → Calls `/.netlify/functions/users` to sync profile
7. → Retrieves user role from database
8. → Stores token in localStorage
9. → Redirects to appropriate dashboard

### Signup Flow:
1. User fills profile info (firstName, lastName, email, phone, adminCode)
2. → Click "Sign Up with Auth0"
3. → Profile stored in sessionStorage
4. → Redirected to Auth0 hosted signup
5. → Auth0 creates account
6. → Redirected back to app
7. → `signup.js` retrieves stored profile
8. → Validates admin code with backend
9. → Calls `/.netlify/functions/users` to create in database
10. → Sets role based on admin code validation
11. → Redirects to appropriate dashboard

## Environment Variables Required

```
AUTH0_DOMAIN              (e.g., auctus.auth0.com)
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID           (from Auth0 Application)
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET       (from Auth0 Application)
AUTH0_AUDIENCE            (e.g., auctus-api)
NEON_DATABASE_URL         (PostgreSQL connection string)
ADMIN_CODE                (Secret admin code for role assignment)
```

## Database Table Structure

The Neon database should have a `users` table with:
- `id` (UUID, primary key)
- `auth0_id` (string, unique)
- `email` (string, unique)
- `firstName` (string)
- `lastName` (string)
- `phone` (string)
- `picture` (string, optional)
- `role` (string, 'admin' or 'user')
- `email_verified` (boolean)
- `created_at` (timestamp)
- `updated_at` (timestamp)

## localStorage Structure

After login/signup, the following are stored in localStorage:
```javascript
{
  auth0_token: "JWT_TOKEN",           // Auth0 token for API calls
  isAuthenticated: "true",             // Authentication flag
  userRole: "admin" or "user",         // User role for access control
  currentUserId: "auth0|USER_ID",      // Auth0 unique user ID
  username: "First Last",              // User's full name
  userEmail: "user@example.com"        // User's email
}
```

## API Endpoints (Netlify Functions)

### POST `/.netlify/functions/users`
**Purpose:** Create or update user in database
**Request:**
```json
{
  "auth0_id": "auth0|123456",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "phone": "555-1234",
  "role": "user",
  "picture": "https://..."
}
```

### GET `/.netlify/functions/users?auth0_id=...`
**Purpose:** Retrieve user profile
**Response:**
```json
{
  "auth0_id": "auth0|123456",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "role": "user",
  "created_at": "2025-10-16T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### POST `/.netlify/functions/admin`
**Purpose:** Validate admin code and manage user roles
**Request:**
```json
{
  "action": "validate-admin-code",
  "adminCode": "secret-admin-code"
}
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "valid": true
}
```

## Security Improvements

1. **No Password Storage:** Passwords are managed by Auth0, not stored in your database
2. **JWT Tokens:** Auth0 provides JWT tokens for secure API calls
3. **Environment Variables:** Secrets are never in code
4. **Serverless Functions:** Backend logic is isolated and secure
5. **Role-Based Access:** Enforced at both frontend and backend
