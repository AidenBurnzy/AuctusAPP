## Overview
I've completely rebuilt the finances section of your Auctus Ventures app to match your Google Sheets functionality. Now you have a comprehensive financial dashboard with real-time calculations!

---

## ‚úÖ What's Been Built

### **1. Database Tables (4 New Tables)**
- ‚úÖ `recurring_income` - Track monthly client payments
- ‚úÖ `subscriptions` - Track monthly subscription costs
- ‚úÖ `budget_allocations` - Set percentage-based budget allocations
- ‚úÖ `employees` - Track employee income splits

### **2. API Endpoints (4 New Netlify Functions)**
- ‚úÖ `/recurring-income` - Full CRUD for client income
- ‚úÖ `/subscriptions` - Full CRUD for subscription management
- ‚úÖ `/allocations` - Full CRUD for budget allocations
- ‚úÖ `/employees` - Full CRUD for employee payroll

### **3. Storage Manager (16 New Methods)**
Each category has 4 methods: get, add, update, delete
- Recurring Income: `getRecurringIncome()`, `addRecurringIncome()`, `updateRecurringIncome()`, `deleteRecurringIncome()`
- Subscriptions: `getSubscriptions()`, `addSubscription()`, `updateSubscription()`, `deleteSubscription()`
- Allocations: `getAllocations()`, `addAllocation()`, `updateAllocation()`, `deleteAllocation()`
- Employees: `getEmployees()`, `addEmployee()`, `updateEmployee()`, `deleteEmployee()`

### **4. Financial Dashboard View**
A completely redesigned finances page with:
- **Summary Cards**: Gross Income, Subscriptions Cost, Net Income
- **Recurring Income Section**: List all client monthly payments
- **Subscriptions Section**: List all monthly subscription costs
- **Budget Allocation Section**: Percentage-based allocations with calculated amounts
- **Employee Payroll Section**: Employee income splits with monthly and yearly totals

### **5. Modal Forms (4 New Modals)**
- ‚úÖ Recurring Income Modal - Add/edit client income sources
- ‚úÖ Subscription Modal - Manage monthly subscriptions
- ‚úÖ Budget Allocation Modal - Set allocation percentages
- ‚úÖ Employee Modal - Manage employee payroll splits

---

## üìã How It Works

### **Financial Calculations (Just Like Your Google Sheet!)**

1. **Gross Monthly Income** = Sum of all recurring client payments
   - Example: Global Windows ($420) + Nightmare Racing ($50) = **$470.00**

2. **Subscriptions Cost** = Sum of all active subscriptions
   - Example: Claude ($91.35) + Neon ($5) + Elevenlabs ($5) + Github ($8) + Github AI ($20) + Netlify ($20) = **$149.35**

3. **Net Monthly Income** = Gross Income - Subscriptions Cost
   - Example: $470.00 - $149.35 = **$320.65**

4. **Budget Allocations** = Net Income √ó Percentage
   - To Savings (35%): $320.65 √ó 0.35 = **$112.23**
   - To Checking (35%): $320.65 √ó 0.35 = **$112.23**
   - To Employees (30%): $320.65 √ó 0.30 = **$96.20**

5. **Employee Payroll** = Net Income √ó Employee Percentage
   - Aiden (60%): $320.65 √ó 0.60 = **$57.72/month** ‚Üí **$692.60/year**
   - Nick (40%): $320.65 √ó 0.40 = **$38.48/month** ‚Üí **$461.74/year**
