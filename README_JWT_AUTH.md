## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1️⃣ Set Environment Variables (2 min)
Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Environment

Add these 3:
```
JWT_SECRET = [from: openssl rand -hex 32]
ADMIN_PASSWORD = [your password]
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = https://auctusventures.netlify.app
```

### 2️⃣ Deploy Code (1 min)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement JWT authentication"
git push
```

### 3️⃣ Test (2 min)
- Clear cache
- Login with password
- Verify token in localStorage
- Test API calls work

**Done! ✅ Your app is now secure**

---

## 🔒 What You Get

### Security Features Added
- ✅ No hardcoded passwords
- ✅ All API endpoints require JWT tokens
- ✅ Tokens expire after 7 days
- ✅ CORS restricted to your domain
- ✅ Error messages don't leak information
- ✅ All secrets in environment variables (never in code)

### For Your 2-Person Team
- Only you and Aiden can login
- Everyone else gets "Unauthorized"
- Token-based authentication (industry standard)
- Automatic token refresh on re-login
- Simple password-based access (no complex auth)

## ⚡ Next Steps

1. **Read** `ACTION_ITEMS.md` (tells you what to do)
2. **Set** environment variables on Netlify (2 minutes)
3. **Deploy** code with `git push` (1 minute)
4. **Test** login works (2 minutes)
5. **Celebrate** 🎉 Your app is now secure!

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

### How It Works
1. User logs in with password
2. Frontend sends password to `/auth` endpoint
3. Backend validates and returns JWT token
4. Token stored in browser (localStorage)
5. All future API requests include the token
6. Backend validates token before allowing operation

### Security Benefits
- Password only sent once at login
- Token used for all subsequent requests
- Tokens expire automatically
- Password never stored anywhere
- Tokens are verified (can't be faked)
- Only authenticated users can access data
